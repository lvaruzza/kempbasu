INTRODUCTION
==============

Kempbasu provide new methods and software for exact p-value calculation of the zero
hypothesis of non-differenced gene expression.

The both p-value calculation methods: the Frequentist and the
Bayesian. Both methods don't depends on any asymptotic result,
therefore can be applied to tags with low total count.

A automatic method for p-value cutoff calculation is also provided.
